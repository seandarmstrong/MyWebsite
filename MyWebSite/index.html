        <h1>Coding and Programming</h1>
        <p>I have been dabbling in coding and programming for several years, playing with languages such
        as HTML, CSS, Python, and some Ruby. These were mainly free online tutorials as I had time and as
        the mood struck me. Then, after taking a year off to travel the world I decided to get serious about
        programming and enrolled in a course through Education 2 Go, an online program for certifications and
        skills training, that focused on the Java language. The Beginner and Intermediate classes I took sealed 
        my fate and I knew I wanted to get serious about it and make a career change. Enter Grand Circus. 
        </p>
        <h1>Long-Term Travel</h1>
        <p>
            In November 2016 I left my job in the marketing and advertising field in preperation for a year long 
            journey. On January 6, 2017 I boarded a plane bound for Costa Rica where I would live for the next 6 
            months teaching English and traveling around that beautiful country.
